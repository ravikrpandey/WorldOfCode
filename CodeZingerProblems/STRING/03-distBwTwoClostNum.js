// Distance between two closest minimum-->

// Given an array of integers, find the minimum distance between any two occurrences of the minimum integer in the array.

 

// Input:

//     8

//     5 1 2 3 4 1 2 1

 

//     where:

// First line represents the number of elements in the array.
// Second line represents the elements of the array.
 

// Output:

//     2

 

// Explanation: The minimum element 1 occurs at indexes: 1, 5 and 7. So the minimum distance is 7-5 = 2.

 

// Assumptions:

// Array can be of size from 1 to 1000.
// Array element can be in the range -1000 to 1000.
// If the minimum value has occurred only once then the output will be '-1'.
